    "## 1.1 Baseline 1: HOG feature extractor\n",
    "In this section we will explore the Histogram Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extractor. The idea of a feature extractor is to, as the name suggests, extract important features out of an image through the orientation of gradients. These features can then be compared to other images to recognise objects or in our case faces. To this end we will create a class which we shall name HOGFeatureExtractor. Upon initialisation of the function we will set several hyper parameters which we will discuss later. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the extractor is called each image will be converted to grey-scale. This allows the edges to be detected more easily. The edges are then converted to polar coordinates, which results in two matrices of the same size as the input image. The first matrix contains the magnitude of the gradient in each point and the second matrix contains the direction of this gradient. The next step is the histogram part of this extractor. Here all the gradients within a cell defined by the user, are gathered into a single histogram. Each bin of this histogram represents a predefined angle, here these angles are 0 to 180 in intervals of 20 degrees. All angles are set between 0 and 180 degrees rather than to 360 degrees. This means that both positive and negative gradients are added to the same angle. (According to source these so called unsigned gradients work better in object recognition that signed gradietns. ) The magnitudes of the gradients are divided amongst their corresponding bins according to their angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the histogram is calculated for every cell, we have converted the image to sets of gradients. The strength of these gradients can depend on the lighting in the picture or shadows on the object. As we would like to determine the features of a face regardless of the light, we need to normalise the gradients. To normalise the gradients we will use block normalisation. This method determine the norm of a block of cells rather than the whole image. By only looking at a smaller region we can mitigate some of the effects of shadows. Once a block is normalised it is added as a one dimensional vector to the feature vector. These steps are then repeated for each block as it slides over the cells with a stride set by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the order of the operations and the nature of the HOG features, they can be rather tricky to plot. In the class we have defined a plotting function which will take the correct features to overlay over an input image such that we can inspect which features are extracted."

    "## 1.2. Baseline 2: PCA feature extractor\n",
    "An important and interesting technique for face image representation is based upon principal component analysis, or PCA. It is a dimensionality reduction method that given a space of D dimensions finds k principal components, or vectors (with k << D) that can be used to remap the input data into a new smaller space still accounting for a good amount of data variance, or information. In this context however, such vectors can be considered \"faces\", in literature called EigenFaces. A face can be described as linear combination of these eigenfaces and the associated coefficients determine the vectorization of the face itself.\n",
    "It is possible to argue that SVD, another dimensionality reduction method, is better performing than PCA because it doesn't require matrix multiplication. However, by centering our input data to 0 (subtracting the average face) PCA behaves as SVD. Indeed, sklearn PCA implementation uses SVD to return the principal components.\n",
    "In this section we will show how to create such space, extract these features for each image and also how we ca reconstruct the input image as linear combination of the chosen eigenfaces. "

    "With this we will conclude this overview of facial recognition methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary we did the following: \n",
    "* The first step in facial recognition is the detection of faces. For this we have seen the light weight HAAR detector and the heavier, but more accurate, detectors in the dlib library.\n",
    "* Regardless of the detector it is always a good practice to inspect the training data for any possible problems.\n",
    "* We saw the HOG feature detector which excells at detecting shapes but is sensitive to rotations and scale.\n",
    "* The PCA which shows slightly better results than HOG feature detector but it is still suboptimal if compared with more advanced neural network based architectures. With eigenfaces we couldn't go past 55% on Kaggle and therefore we decided to move to something more advanced.\n",
    "* Lastly we looked at state of the art facial recognition with FaceNet. This deep neural network recognises faces with  extremely high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep neaural networks are able to extract more meaningful features than machine learning models. The downfall of these big networks is however the need for a huge amount of data. We managed to cope with this issue by using a pretrained model, a model that has been trained on a way bigger dataset in order to retain knowledge on how to encode face images, that we then used for our purposes in this competition. We spent a lot of time improving the quality of the few images we had to work with but if we had more time we might have improved their quality a bit more so that we could have gotten even better results. In addition, fine tuning the classifier of our last model even more would have definitely helped out more. \n",
    "In general, what we discovered however is that what matters most is the quality of the vectorization of each image. A model such us the one we have exploited has fine grained capabilities on vectorizing the images in a meaningful way while the initial methods."
