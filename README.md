# Oneshot_facerecognition

I couldn't upload the full notebook as it was going over 25MBs.
The notebook uploaded is just for showing preprcssing and other simple face recognition technique. 
.py file contains all the code from start to end.

This project uses one-shot learning-based (Siamese network based on inception-based models) face recognition. The model was trained on an extremely small dataset of 67 images, no image augmentation was used for the training. Using SVM as the base classifier after combining features from One-shot learning and handcrafted features we were able to get an accuracy of 98% on 1800+ test images.
